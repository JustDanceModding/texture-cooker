## How to use
In the "toCook" folder you need to put your textures (dosen't matter which format)
Run the cooker of the platform you're going to cook for, ex. cook-ps3.py
And then on the folder "cookedTex" you'll get the cooked textures in  base of your platform. ex. "cookedTex/ps3/texture.tga.ckd"

Create a "bin" folder and inside you put the programs required for the cooking. ex. "bin\dds2gtf.exe"

## TODO
- Refactor the header classes as our implementation is not so right.
- Wii Encoding
